# ParGOGraphs

This package was made for learning purposes during my masters in Computer Science at [Universidade Federal do Cear√° (UFC)](http://www.mdcc.ufc.br/), not to be considered a substitute for [Graphs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/Graphs.jl), of which this package is heavily based on. The package is named after the [ParGO](https://pargo.ufc.br/en/presentation/) research group.
